# Milestone Project 2
## Interactive Frontend Development
## FinTech Card Game

### Purpose
The purpose of this website is to create a card game based on fast paced execution, to find matching pairs based on a randomly selected ticker, find and match a pair of company logo's based on the ticker shown and execute the trade within the timer window. The timer will randomly generate how long the player has to find the pair, to keep the game chanllenging. Each pair successfully found will contribute to the players score, each missed pair will reduce the players score.

#### Wireframe

### Design

A Playful and creative font was used to highlight the nature of the website in headings and labels the font chosen was
 sourced from [Google Fonts] and called [Rubik Scribble]

 Pattern.monster was used to create the back of card pattern, the CSS was automatically generated by the website and copied into the background-image url
 * [Card Pattern](https://pattern.monster/squares-and-diamonds/)

The website presents with very little on the page to start with and will interactively display the cards aty the point the user clicks start, this is a design choice to ensure the user is not ditracted by the visuals of the card before having a chance to read and understand the game instruction.

The timer is present and centeral to the page to ensure it is always visible, the time is presented in bold with an increased font weight to the text around it to ensure its visibility.
