## Purpose
The purpose of this website is to create a card game based on fast paced execution, to find matching pairs based on a randomly selected ticker, find and match a pair of company logo's based on the ticker shown and execute the trade within the timer window. The timer will randomly generate how long the player has to find the pair, to keep the game chanllenging. Each pair successfully found will contribute to the players score, each missed pair will reduce the players score, if the timer hits zero the players bank will be reduced. The game is designed to create pressure on the player to stay focused on the cards and not distracted by the timer.

The website was built with the intention of creating both an enjoyable and yet challenging experience for the user.

## Technologies Used
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScirpt
* Email JS API
* Fetch API

## Tools 
* Moqups
* Visual Studio Code

## UX

### User Stories
* As a user I would like to experience a fun and interactive game that is also educational and enjoyable to play
* As a user I would like to be able to navigate around the website simply and easily, with a clean and comfortable User Interface
* As a user of this website I would like to understand how to play the game in a simple and uncomplicated manner

## UI
### Design
* As a user of this website I would like a clean simple and interactive webpage to use and navigate easily

### Wireframe
![Wireframe Using Mockup](/assets/images/Wireframe-moqups.png)

### Prototype

### Colour Scheme

#### Font
A Playful and creative font was used to highlight the nature of the website in headings and labels the font chosen was
 sourced from [Google Fonts] and called [Rubik Scribble]

#### Card Pattern Design
 Pattern.monster was used to create the back of card pattern, the CSS was automatically generated by the website and copied into the background-image url
 * [Card Pattern](https://pattern.monster/squares-and-diamonds/)

The website presents with very little on the page to start with and will interactively display the cards at the point the user clicks start, this is a design choice to ensure the user is not distracted by the visuals of the card before having a chance to read and understand the game instruction.

The timer is present and centeral to the page to ensure it is always visible, the time is presented in bold with an increased font weight to the text around it to ensure its visibility.

## Features

## Feautures not Implemented
Ideas that where initially considered and where either not implemented due to technical restrictions, time or where considered off the critical path for the project but may always be implemented later.
*Link card data to yahoo finance API to update cards and logos / tickers with the most valuable tech stocks at the point of play.
* Highscore board storage of data / information to retain highscore from players, this could be done in local / session or cookie storage but would not have fully utilised the feature as it would not enable different users on different machines to compete.
* Adding and removing CSS when the player runs out of time to highlight the bank being reduced and create a sense of panic.
* Implementing modals instead of alerts, the benefit of alert is that it pasues the running functions, however time did not allow me to add modals to replace the alerts used in game.

## Testing
### HTML Validator

### CSS Validator

### JS Validator (JSHint.com)

### User Testing / Alpha Testing
* As part of user testing the start button was highlighted as "not too obvious" to start the game, I have added a description in the instructions to locate and use start.

* User testing noted that the bank was highlighted as a link this has been removed, as part of the class it is still highlighted as the cursor goes over it, but does not change the cursor to highlight a clickable link.

* 

### JEST Test Suite
*As part of the development process JEST was consdiered as part of the automated testing strategy but I have opted on this occasion to avoid the TDD route as I am keen to develop the code and my understanding of Javascript including manually testing code and via automated online validators. I would like to produce a suite of JEST tests later on but it does not form part of the project critical path.

## API's

### Email JS
Email JS has been used to add functionality to the contact form enabling site users to conact the developer with any bugs or suggested improvements.

Code Instute Module on Email JS facilitated the implimentation along with the Email JS Documentation and example code

The API has been successfully linked and displays a console log message and response status code after clicking the submit button to feedback whether the communication has been successful. The console log in this event has deliberately been left in to allow persons reviewing to see the functionality and act as proof of its correct use, however if this was not a marked project the console logs would remain clear and a try / catch statement would be implimented to bring the users attention to either successful or failed communication.

### Buges & Fixes
*Start Stop not updating or changing state.
-Fix Timeout added - If stop double clicked game will end and update game state

*Random time generator can generate 0 as time
-Fix if statement if 0 add 10

* Timer function froze
  - Moved function call out of gameFunc

* Timer would continue counting after game play ended
  - Set clearInterval to stop timer counting down

* Shuffle deck not updating cards
  - Added line to clear innerHTML of grid container then call generate cards function

*Pressing execute button before start button or selecting cards would lead to typeError
  - Set alert to inform user to select cards before clicking execute and reload the page to clear console error log

#### Remaining Bugs
* It is possible to have 3 cards flipped at the same time if selecting 1 then two then unselecting 1 and the selecting another 2 cards
  -No fix implemented at this stage
